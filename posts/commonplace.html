<p>&#8220;We are so utterly ordinary, so commonplace, while we profess to know a Power the Twentieth Century does not reckon with. But we are &#8216;harmless,&#8217; and therefore unharmed. We are spiritual pacifists, non-militants, conscientious objectors in this battle-to-the-death with principalities and powers in high places. Meekness must be had for contact with men, but brass, outspoken boldness is required to take part in the comradeship of the Cross. We are &#8216;sideliners&#8217;&#8212;coaching and criticizing the real wrestlers while content to sit by and leave the enemies of God unchallenged. The world cannot hate us, we are too much like its own. Oh that God would make us dangerous!&#8221;</p>
