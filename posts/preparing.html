<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t learn to speak a language in a couple of months. It will be plugging for a good while yet. Seems that I&#8217;ll never get through &#8216;preparing&#8217; for the mission field. But I&#8217;ve been comforted this week thinking of our Lord&#8217;s thirty silent years of readying Himself at home with His family and bending over a carpenter&#8217;s bench. Were those days any less of a fragrance to God than His later work before the eyes of the people? I think not. A well-made piece of furniture and a healed blind man represented the same thing to the Father&#8212;a job well done; mission accomplished. So with us here. Nothing great, but what is that to Him with whom there is no great or small?&#8221;</p>
