<p>&#8220;This is just such a day as it shall be when the Son of Man is revealed. Evidently, the removal of the bride will have little effect upon the thinking of the world; it may be that <em>the</em> lie of 2 Thessalonians 2:11 will be the son of perdition&#8217;s explanation of where or why he has gone. Business, social affairs, domestic responsibility will be going on as they are today, when His lightning shall split the heavens and the sword of His mouth cleave brother from brother in bed and neighbor from neighbor at the mill. There will be no arguments as to whether or not it is He. No discussions or panels will be convened as to the import of certain events and their implications. But suddenly, with but slight warning, shall the inhabitants of the earth know the Lord&#8217;s Christ.&#8221;</p>
