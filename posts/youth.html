<p>&#8220;For youth there is special wretchedness, for then the powers within conflict most bluntly with the powers without. Restraint is most galling, release most desired. To compensate for these, youth has special powers. &#8216;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you; and ye have overcome the Wicked One.&#8217; Unusual strength is a premium for youth; acuteness and retentive powers are more real in youth; victory sweetest in youth. Lord, let me live to the hilt, exerting all its force, loosing all its fire. In Solomonic wisdom, I would <em>rejoice</em> in youth, yet <em>remember</em> my Creator.&#8221;</p>
